title: Why you should adopt Bootstrap
---
	
	With more and more people across the world
	accessing the web using their mobile devices,
	it becomes neccessary that webpages need to adapt
	the way they are rendered to this new environment 
	of access. In comes Bootstrap to save the day!.

	Bootstrap is a front-end framework created by twitter that was designed to make development easier across many different kinds of displays. So now instead of having to use some form of detection to find out whether the client is using a mobile device or computer, Bootstrap allows you to place content into an environment that arranges all content into columms. These columns can then change their size and location based on the devices display. So instead of having to use horizontal scrolling when accessing the page,
	the client can now see the same content, but now 
	resized and ordered appropriately for their device.

	A few cool things about Bootstrap are the vast amount
	of community created HTML/CSS templates and themes that
	are available to be used or modified to fit your needs.
	Another is that Bootstrap is responsive enough to adapt
	to your own open browser on your computer, so as you
	resize your browser window, Bootstrap will update the 
	page accordingly as it happens. Also packaged inside
	is several jQuery plug-ins to make cool user interface
	components. 

	So if you want to make your website accessible on
	various devices without having to create a downsized,
	minimal, and probably uglier version, I highly recommend
	you to adopt Bootstrap.
