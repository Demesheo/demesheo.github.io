title: Reasons you should blog about your technical tribulations
---

Blogging is a very common and constantly evolving thing now a days,
with millions of people blogging about millions of different topics.
And what you blog about may not impact you, since it is simply you
sharing your thoughts with everybody else that could wander across your page,
but it may impact your readers, and that is what makes blogging about
your personal experiences, challenges, and opinions about things that are
relevent to your current or past projects. The time when you couldnt figure out why
your routing wasnt handling requests the way you had originally expected even though you
followed the directions in the docs down to last detail until you had that magical moment
of understanding would make an excellent blog post. You could make that potential blog post
even better by documenting exactly what your original issue was, steps you took to solve it,
why your original ideas and fixes didn't work, and the path you took to get from your dissapointing
and non-working solution to your fruitful and blissful moment of truth when it finally did everything
it was supposed to. Chances are that somebody else will eventually run into the same problems you have,
and by documenting your experiences makes your blog a valuable resource for somebody else to learn from.
Also you could forget how you solved that problem and when you face it again have to stumble down the same
path all over again when you could easily have just loaded up your blog and read how you did it last time.
What is important is that you had a problem and found a way to get through it, or around it, or over it, 
and during this time you documented your experiences and reasons why you followed that direction.
You never know who could be reading your blog, whether it is somebody that is just now learning to code
for the first time, or it could be a senior developer at facebook. Everybody's first idea whenever
they are faced with something they don't know the answer to is to google it, and everybody who
didn't know what you used to not know could soon find themselves hailing you as their hero. Or
decide they want to give you a job. When it comes to blogging, by helping others, you are only
helping yourself.
