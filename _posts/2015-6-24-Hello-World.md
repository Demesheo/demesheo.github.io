title: A couple of things to know before you create your first 3rd party app
---

	As we begin to hone our programming skills we often find
	ourselves imagining what kind of apps we will be building
	in the near future. For some of us, these ideas often mean
	implementing api's from some of our favorite apps.

	As excited as you should be to start working on that awesome
	idea of yours, there are a few things you should know
	beforehand.

	1. Read the Terms Of Service
	
	2. Read the Terms Of Service again
	
	3. Find out how much support is provided by the parent company
		for api's, how is the documentation? Are there any
		libraries out there already to help expedite the build
		process for you before you begin to write your own code?
	
	4. Be aware of any data/legal limitations
	
	5. If you have any idea of a loophole around limitations,
		is it still within the TOS? And is there any possibility
		of this loophole jeopardizing your project?
	
	6. How much does your own app rely on the 3rd party's current
		state. If this were to change, how many changes would
		you need to make to keep your project running?
	
	7. What makes your project beneficial to the user experience?
		Not only how well implemented is the 3rd party material,
		but what features will make it stand out against and
		hopefully above the 3rd party's own app or website? 

	For obvious reasons, reading the Terms of Service is very
	important, and as long and boring as they may seem they
	can save you from a world of hurt.

	Just as important is finding out what kind of support is
	offered for api's by the 3rd party. Some even have their
	own libraries, awesome documentation, forums, and many
	other resources to help you. While just as many other's 
	may basically offer you no kind of useful help.

	The data/legal limitations are often implied in the TOS 
	agreements, but it is your own duty to do research them
	and make sure you stay within the guidelines. Liability
	is a big concern here.

	The rest is pretty self explanatory, and should head you 
	in the right direction with planning your own apps when 
	making use of a 3rd party api. Just always remember to
	work smarter, not harder, have fun, and get out there 
	and make that app you always dreamed of that scours every

	been a family kept secret for 9 generations.
