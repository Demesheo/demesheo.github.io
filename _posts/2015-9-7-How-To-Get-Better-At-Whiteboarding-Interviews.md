title: How to get better at whiteboarding interviews
---


If you are a software engineer, of all things you want to do, becoming better at conveying your ideas is probably on your list. If it's not, then it should be. Being good at explaining something just as well as you understand it can lead you to some good jobs out there. So here are some things you should know and put into practice before your technical interview. 

The first thing on the list is speaking clearly and confidently, announcing every step to whoever is watching you whiteboard. Speak directly to them. Nothing is worse than sitting through an hour of listening to somebody murmur and stumble over words while talking to the wall. It takes away from the process for them to have to ask you to speak up, and by the time someone asks you to speak up it's because they've probably already missed something.

Next is to always ask questions. This is just as important as the first. Asking questions helps you to be on the same page as your interviewer and will almost always lead to some type of hint towards a solution whether they realize they are telling you or not. The questions you ask will also clarify to the interviewer your understanding of the surrounding concepts which is the reason you are being interviewed in the first place. The must ask questions for a whiteboarding session will always include time/space complexity and edge cases. The main idea to remember is that during this time, what they are looking at more than anything is your communication skills. So if you have any questions as you move through the problem be sure to ask them and never make assumptions.

Following this, you should know the proper steps to take during the whiteboarding session. If you don't, then continue reading along. The first is to take a small corner of the board to put your notes, these notes should include time/space complexity, input, output, edge cases, requirements, and any other things that are important to defining the confines of the problem. Second is to the make diagrams of a possible solution. The reason for this is that you want to give your interviewer a visual representation of your idea of solving the problem.
